ðŸ‘‹ I'm what you'd call a geek. 

I love technology (in any shape or form), collectibles, Back to the Future and so many other things. 
Most of all though, I love my wife, dog and cat. Whenever I'm not working I spend as much quality time with them as possible. 

After working for a cloud service provider for more than 20 years, I recently switched jobs. I started working for a small but great company (Etesian IT Consulting, https://etesian.nl/) with huge ambitions (and they've been living up to it).

Most of the stuff I publish here is part of my adventures in the world of blogging. For now, most stuff is on my Gist (https://gist.github.com/NielsS79). 

I post on the following channels:

You can also always reach me by email. I'll do my best to respond.
